# pretzelmecanumchassis

I have competed in ftc for two years now and i have also competed in frc for a year. i currently am the unofficial team captain of our ftc team in ontario. i wanted to challenge myself by creating a chassis for a robot idea of a wheel type i have never been able to use before, that wheel type being mecanum. as before our ftc team had only used / created a basic tank drive and an x drive. this design was a fun challenge for me to come up with a unique idea / possible idea to go towards for our 2024 - 2025 robot chassis. however the great part that im most optimistic about is that there is a possibility that our team may have the resources to bring a chassis idea like this to life. which would be awesome for our team and give us a huge challenge for next years game.
